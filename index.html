          <h2>Singing for Your Supper Isn't Easy</h2>
          <p>Hi! I'm Rick Klaras. Music is a big part of my life. I've been playing guitar since I was 10, and
            I've played in bands since I was a teenager.</p>

          <p>Paying the bills with music is easier said than done, so I've developed many different skills
              over the years to make ends meet. I've been a:

              <ul>
                <li>television cameraman</li>
                <li>salesman</li>
                <li>high school teacher</li>
                <li>freelance writer</li>
               </ul>

              <p> Most recently, I've started my own guitar lesson business. I currently have <strong>20
               students</strong>.</p>
             </p>
             <p>I love my guitar students, and I enjoy teaching immensely, but the guitar lesson
              business can be pretty unpredictable. When money gets tight, music instruction
              is often the first thing to go.</p>

              <p>Making a living from performing and recording is even tougher. These days,
                it's just about impossible to make ends meet as a working musician, especially if you
                have kids to support.</p>

                <h2>Why Coding? Why Now?</h2>

                <p>So why, at 35, have I decided to become a programmer? Well, I'd be lying if I said
                  that money had nothing to do with it.  </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Career prospects in tech seem promising.</li>
                      <li>Starting salaries for junior programmers are respectable.</li>
                      <li>My kids will be college-aged in a few years.</li>
                      <li> It's time to get serious.</li>
                    </ol>


                  <p>But there's more to it than that. I've always been fascinated by technology.
                    I remember playing around on the Commodore 64 back in elementary school, and
                    going to the library to play King's Quest or Carmen Sandiego. </p>

                    <p>I got the G1 when the Android OS was first introduced. I was wowed by
                      the applications and the capabilities of the gyroscope. The fact that I
                      could "look around" in Google streetview was stunning!</p>

                    <p>I'm amazed by the power of digital audio workstations like Pro Tools
                      and Ableton Live; how can much music come from "infinitely reproducible
                      nothings?"</p>

                  <p>I've even dabbled in coding a bit over the years, customizing band pages and
                  business websites through trial and error. I often have ideas for cool (and horrible) applications,
                  and I'd really like to learn how to create them.</p>

                  <p>I've been intrigued by computers for just about as long as I can remember.</p>

                  <h2>Finding the Music in the Code</h2>

                  <p>Code and music may appear to be dissimilar, but they have much in common.
                    They both have their codices and conventions. Both are language. Both are information.
                    Both are living art forms in constant flux.</p>

                    <p>I hope to find the music in the code. To get beneath the syntax and play it like
                      an instrument. To use it as a tool for creative expression. </p>

                      <p>Or, you know... <em>at least</em> start a succesful career so I can afford to have
                        a proper mid-life crisis when the time comes. It pays to plan ahead.</p>
