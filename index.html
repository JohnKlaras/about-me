          <h2>Singing for Your Supper Isn't Easy</h2>
          <p>Hi! I'm Rick Klaras. Music is a big part of my life. I've been playing guitar since I was 10, and I've been in bands since I was
            a teenager.</p>
            <p>I've developed many different skills over the years; I've been a:
              <ul>
                <li>television cameraman</li>
                <li>salesman</li>
                <li>high school teacher</li>
                <li>freelance writer</li>


               </ul>
              <p> Most recently, I've started my own guitar lesson business. I currently have <strong>20
               students</strong>!</p>
             </p>
             <p>I love my guitar students, and I enjoy teaching immensely, but the guitar lesson
              business can be pretty unpredictable. When money gets tight, music instruction
              is often the first thing to go.</p>

              <p>Making a living from performing and recording is even tougher. These days,
                it's just about impossible to make ends meet as a working musician.</p>

                <h2>Why Coding? Why Now?</h2>

                <p>So why, at 35, have I decided to become a computer programmer?</p>

                <p>Well, I'd be lying if I said that money had nothing to do with it. Career
                  prospects in tech seem promising. Starting
                  salaries for junior programmers are pretty respectable, and my kids
                  will be college-aged in a few years. It's time to get serious.</p>

                  <p>But there's more to it than that. I've always been fascinated by technology.
                    I remember playing around on the Commodore 64 back in elementary school, and
                    going to the library to play King's Quest and Carmen Sandiego. </p>

                    <p>I'm amazed by the power of digital audio workstations like Pro Tools
                      and Ableton Live; how so much music can come from "infinitely reproducible
                      nothings."</p>

                  <p>I've even dabbled in coding a bit over the years, customizing band pages and
                  business websites through trial and error. I've been intrigued by computers for
                  as long as I can remember.</p>

                  <h2>Finding the Music in the Code</h2>

                  <p>Code and music may appear to be dissimilar, but they have much in common.
                    They both have their codices and conventions. Both are language. Both are data.
                    Both are living art forms in constant flux.</p>

                    <p>I hope to find the music in the code. To get beneath the syntax and play it like
                      an instrument. </p>

                      <p>Or, you know... <em>at least</em> get a really good job.</a>
